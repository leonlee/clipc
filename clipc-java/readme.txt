This directory contains the Java (OS independent) files for the CLIPC 
library.  The complete version should also contain a directory with the 
native (OS dependent) C files.

Any 1.6 Java compiler should suffice to build the Java files.  Development
was done using 1.6.0_12.

The linux version was built with the default gcc.  The uname -all for that
system was:

Linux fedora 2.6.27.19-170.2.35.fc10.i686 #1 SMP Mon Feb 23 13:21:22 EST 2009 i686 i686 i386 GNU/Linux

The gcc --version info (minus the licensing info) was:

gcc (GCC) 4.3.2 20081105 (Red Hat 4.3.2-7)

The basic development environment was Eclipse 3.4.2 with the 5.0.2 version 
of the C/C++ environment.
