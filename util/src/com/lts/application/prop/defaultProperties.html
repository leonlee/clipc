<H1>The Default Properties Properties Pattern</H1>

<H2>Intent/Motivation</H2>
<A name="intent">
Simplify the way that properties obtain default values.
</A>

<h2>Motivation/Example</h2>
<a name="motivation">
You have an application that shows which directories contain the most storage space,
perhaps for the user to figure out which directories to clean up.  The application can 
create cache files so that all the directories do not have to be rescanned every time
the program runs.
  
<P>
In some situations, you may want to force the program to rescan the 
directories, so you make this a configuration property called "use cache files."  Most 
of the time, however, you want to use cache files, so the default value should be true. 
</P>

<P>
In order to allow the default values to change when needed, it is desireable to reframe
from forcing the developer to use Properties.getProperty(String name, String defaultValue)
because it makes the code more difficult to maintain --- rather than a single location
that defines the default value, multiple locations have that "knowledge."  
</P>

<P>
The solution is to create a class that defines the following method:
</P>

<P>
<CODE>
<PRE>
public String[][] getDefaultValues();
public void loadDefaults();
</PRE>
</CODE>
</P>

<H4>loadDefaults</H4>
This method gets the specification returned by getDefaultValues and processes it.  Each
row in the array is itself an array that consists of a name and a value.  This method
merely calls Properties.setProperty to set the named property to the specified value.

<H4>getDefaultValues</H4>
This method returns a "specification" that consists of several rows like the following:

<P>
<CODE>
<PRE>
	public class ApplicationProperties extends Properties
	{
		public String[][] getDefaultValues() {
			return null;
		}
		
		public void loadDefaults() 
		{...}
	}
	
	public class ScanProperties extends ApplicationProperties
	{
		public static final String[][] spec = {
			"useCache",		"true"
		};
		
		public String[][] getDefaultValues() {
			return spec;
		}
	}
</PRE>
</CODE>
</P>
</a>

<H2>Applicability</H2>
<A name="Applicability">
In situations where default values are not needed or where the default values are not
going to change frequently, this pattern will provide limited value.  In situations 
where developers must know the default value of a property when they use it, this 
pattern will actually be more trouble then it is worth.
